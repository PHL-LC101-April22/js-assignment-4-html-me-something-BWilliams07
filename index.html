           <p> I first discovered my love for baking when I was in college. I remember I had a very stressful semester and I needed a hobby for some relaxation. 
                It was in the middle of Fall so I couldn't spend my time on the beach - "wastin' away again in Margaritaville". I desperately needed something else 
                to do. I was tired of spending my free time at the gym so I figured baking would be the next best thing! *Who says you can't have margaritas and cupcakes?!

            <p> A lot of people associate baking with either being boring or being like Betty Crocker and Martha Stewart - (minus the stock fraud that is!). Believe it or not, baking 
                is creative and every creative hobby releases <strong>endorphines</strong> in your brain! I liked that every time I was stressed I could just look up a recipe
                and lose myself in the kitchen. For a momment in time all of my problems no longer existed. The only thing I had to worry about was not burning down the house! 
                (never a dull moment there!)
               <p> Reasons I picked up baking as a hobby:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li> You can be as creative as you want, there's no limit! 
                    <li> You can eat the finished result!</li>
                    <li> Sweets also release endorphines, so double the dose of <strong> happy :) </strong>
                </ol>

            <p>Through baking I discovered that I might actually have a creative side to my being! Ehhh or maybe not. While I mastered 
                not burning the house down, there's still a lot of work to be done as far as creativity goes! I might not be able to create the best 
                masterpieces yet, but baking continues to help me keep my sanity. Even if I'm no Marth stewart or Betty Crocker I will still always love baking! 
                I won't have my own baking show one day but I definetly have the skills to star in the show <strong> "Nailed It!" </strong> (baking fails).
